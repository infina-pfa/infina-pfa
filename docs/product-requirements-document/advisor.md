# AI Advisor Chat - Product Requirements Document (PRD)

## Executive Summary

The AI Advisor Chat is an intelligent conversational interface that combines traditional chat functionality with interactive UI components. This feature allows users to have natural conversations with an AI financial advisor while enabling the AI to dynamically render tools, forms, and components within the chat interface for enhanced user interaction and immediate financial guidance.

## User Stories & Core Features

### 1. Chat Interface

**As a user, I want a clean chat UI with:**

- Input field positioned at the bottom of the screen
- Message bubbles with distinct styling:
  - User messages: Primary brand color background (`#0055FF`)
  - AI messages: White background with subtle shadow/border
- Scrollable message history
- Typing indicators when AI is responding

### 2. Fresh Conversation Experience

**As a user, I want each chat session to be fresh:**

- No loading of previous conversations on page entry
- Clean state with personalized welcome message: "Hi, [UserName]"
- Pre-defined suggestion actions to start conversations:
  - "Help me create a budget"
  - "Analyze my spending patterns"
  - "Plan my financial goals"
  - "Review my investments"
- Suggestions disappear once conversation begins

### 3. Interactive UI Components

**As a user, I want the AI to show interactive tools:**

- **Desktop**: Split-screen layout with chat on left, component on right
- **Mobile**: Modal/popup overlay with the interactive component
- Components include:
  - Budget creation forms
  - Expense tracking widgets
  - Financial goal planners
  - Investment calculators
  - Spending analysis charts

### 4. Contextual AI Responses

**As a user, I want the AI to understand my tool interactions:**

- AI monitors user actions within rendered components
- Provides immediate feedback and advice based on interactions
- Suggests next steps or optimizations
- Learns from user behavior to improve recommendations

- [x] Real-time UI updates based on user actions

## Technical Requirements

### Frontend Architecture

```typescript
// Core chat types
interface ChatMessage {
  id: string;
  content: string;
  sender: "user" | "ai";
  timestamp: Date;
  componentData?: ComponentRenderData;
}

interface ComponentRenderData {
  type: "budget-form" | "expense-tracker" | "goal-planner" | "calculator";
  props: Record<string, any>;
  onInteraction?: (action: string, data: any) => void;
}
```

### Backend Integration

- WebSocket connection for real-time messaging
- AI service integration (OpenAI/Custom model)
- Component state management API
- User context and profile integration
- Session management (temporary, no persistence)

### UI Components Required

- `ChatInterface` - Main chat container
- `MessageBubble` - Individual message display
- `ChatInput` - Message input with send functionality
- `WelcomeScreen` - Initial state with suggestions
- `ComponentRenderer` - Dynamic component injection
- `SplitLayout` - Desktop split-screen view
- `MobileModal` - Mobile component overlay

## UI/UX Specifications

### Design System Compliance

- **Colors**: Follow Infina brand palette
  - User messages: `#0055FF` (Bright Royal Blue)
  - AI messages: `#FFFFFF` with `#F0F2F5` border
  - Success states: `#2ECC71` (Emerald Green)
  - Warning states: `#FFC107` (Amber Yellow)
  - Error states: `#F44336` (Reddish Coral)

### Typography

- **Font**: Nunito family throughout
- **Message text**: Regular weight, appropriate sizing
- **Timestamps**: Lighter weight, smaller size
- **System messages**: Italic styling

### Layout Specifications

- **Desktop**:
  - Chat panel: 40% width (minimum 400px)
  - Component panel: 60% width (when active)
  - Collapsible sidebar for component history
- **Mobile**:
  - Full-width chat interface
  - Modal overlay for components (90% viewport height)
  - Swipe gestures for component navigation

### Animation & Interactions

- Smooth message appearance animations
- Typing indicator with dot animations
- Component slide-in transitions
- Subtle hover states on interactive elements

## User Experience Flow

### Initial Load

1. User navigates to chat page
2. System displays welcome message with user's name
3. Show 4-6 suggestion buttons for common actions
4. Input field is focused and ready for typing

### Starting Conversation

1. User clicks suggestion OR types message
2. Suggestions disappear
3. User message appears in chat
4. AI processes and responds
5. If AI suggests tool, render component accordingly

### Tool Interaction Flow

1. AI determines need for interactive component
2. **Desktop**: Split layout appears, component loads on right
3. **Mobile**: Modal opens with component
4. User interacts with component
5. AI receives interaction events
6. AI provides contextual advice in chat
7. Process continues until user closes tool or conversation ends

### Session Management

- Each page visit creates new conversation ID
- No message history loaded from previous sessions
- Session data cleared on page refresh/navigation away
- Component state tied to current session only

## Success Metrics

### User Engagement

- Average conversation length (messages per session)
- Tool interaction rate (% of conversations using components)
- Suggestion click-through rate
- Session duration and return frequency

### AI Effectiveness

- Query resolution rate
- User satisfaction ratings
- Follow-through on AI recommendations
- Successful tool completion rates

### Technical Performance

- Message delivery latency (<200ms)
- Component rendering speed (<500ms)
- WebSocket connection stability (>99.5% uptime)
- Mobile responsiveness scores

## Technical Considerations

### Security

- Input sanitization for all messages
- Component props validation
- XSS prevention in rendered components
- Rate limiting for AI requests

### Performance

- Message virtualization for long conversations
- Component lazy loading
- WebSocket connection pooling
- Caching for AI responses when appropriate

### Accessibility

- Keyboard navigation support
- Screen reader compatibility
- High contrast mode support
- Focus management in modals

### Mobile Optimization

- Touch-friendly interface elements
- Gesture support for component interaction
- Optimized layout for small screens
- Performance considerations for slower devices

## Dependencies

### External Services

- AI/LLM service (OpenAI API or similar)
- WebSocket infrastructure
- User authentication system
- Component state management

### Internal Systems

- User profile service
- Financial data APIs
- Notification system

## Risk Mitigation

### Technical Risks

- **AI service downtime**: Implement fallback responses and graceful degradation
- **WebSocket failures**: Auto-reconnection with exponential backoff
- **Component rendering errors**: Error boundaries and fallback UI

### User Experience Risks

- **Complex UI confusion**: Progressive disclosure and onboarding tooltips
- **Mobile performance**: Aggressive caching and component optimization
- **AI response quality**: Continuous model training and feedback loops
