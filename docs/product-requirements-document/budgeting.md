## 1. Overview & Goal

This document outlines the requirements for a new **Budgeting Feature** within the Infina application. The primary goal is to empower users to take control of their finances by providing them with intuitive tools to create and manage monthly budgets, track their income and expenses, and gain clear insights into their spending habits.

By integrating this feature, we aim to increase user engagement, provide tangible value that helps users improve their financial health, and solidify Infina as a comprehensive personal finance management tool.

## 2. Target Audience

This feature is for all Infina users who want to:
- Proactively manage their monthly spending.
- Understand where their money is going.
- Work towards financial goals by controlling their expenditures.

## 3. Functional Requirements (User Stories)

### 3.1. Core Budget Management
- **As a user, I want to create a budget for a specific category** (e.g., "Groceries", "Transport", "Entertainment") with a defined monthly spending limit.
- **As a user, I want to view all my budgets for the current month** in a single place, showing how much I've spent for each.
- **As a user, I want to edit** the name and amount of an existing budget.
- **As a user, I want to delete** a budget that I no longer need.

### 3.2. Transaction Management
- **As a user, I want to add an income or expense transaction**, assigning it to a relevant budget category.
- **As a user, I want to specify the date, amount, and a short description** for each transaction.
- **As a user, I want to mark a transaction as recurring** (e.g., monthly salary, rent payment) so that it's automatically created each month.
- **As a user, I want to view a list of all my transactions** for a selected period, with the ability to filter by category (budget), type (income/expense), and date.
- **As a user, I want to edit or delete** a previously entered transaction.

### 3.3. Monthly Cycle & Automation
- **As a user, I want my budgets and recurring transactions to automatically carry over** to the next month, so I don't have to set them up manually every time.
- **As a system, on the first day of each month, a job should clone all budgets and create instances of all recurring transactions** for the new month.
- **As a user, I want to be able to navigate between months** to see my budgeting data and transaction history from previous periods.

### 3.4. Dashboard & Insights
- **As a user, I want a dashboard that gives me an overview of my financial health** for the current month.
- **On the dashboard, I want to clearly see the total amount of money I have left to spend** this month.
- **On the dashboard, I want to see a line chart** that visualizes my daily spending over the current month.
- **On the dashboard, I want to see a breakdown of my top spending categories** to quickly understand where most of my money is going.

### 3.5. Data Synchronization
- **As a user, I expect my total asset value to be accurately updated** in real-time whenever an income or expense transaction is recorded.

## 4. UI/UX Design Concepts

### 4.1. Web Application
- **Layout:** A clean, two-column layout is recommended. A persistent sidebar for navigation (e.g., Dashboard, Budgets, Transactions) and a main content area.
- **Dashboard:**
    - **Key Metrics:** Use prominent cards at the top for "Remaining This Month," "Total Income," and "Total Expenses."
    - **Spending Chart:** A large, interactive line chart showing spending over time. Tooltips on hover should reveal spending for a specific day.
    - **Top Budgets:** A donut chart or a horizontal bar chart to visualize the top 3-5 spending categories.
- **Budgets Page:**
    - Display budgets as a list of cards. Each card should show the **Category Name**, **Budgeted Amount**, **Spent Amount**, and a **visual progress bar**.
    - A clear "Add New Budget" button should be present.
- **Transactions Page:**
    - A data table with sortable columns (Date, Description, Category, Amount).
    - Use color to distinguish income (green) from expenses (red).
    - A prominent "Add Transaction" button that opens a modal form.
    - Filtering controls should be readily accessible at the top of the table.

### 4.2. Mobile Application
- **Layout:** A standard bottom tab bar for primary navigation. Tabs could be: **Dashboard**, **Budgets**, **+ (Add)**, **Transactions**, **Profile**.
- **Dashboard Screen (Home):**
    - The most critical metric, **"Remaining to Spend,"** should be displayed at the very top.
    - A compact, non-interactive version of the spending chart.
    - A list of the 3-5 most recent transactions.
- **Budgets Screen:**
    - A vertical, scrollable list of all budget categories.
    - Each item should show the category and its progress bar. Tapping a budget could navigate to a detailed view with all transactions for that category.
- **Add Transaction:**
    - The central **"+"** tab or a Floating Action Button (FAB) should open a simple, full-screen form to quickly add a new transaction. This is a primary user action and must be effortless.
- **Transactions Screen:**
    - A chronological, infinitely scrolling list of all transactions, grouped by day (e.g., "Today," "Yesterday," "June 28").
    - A search bar and filter icon should be placed at the top.

## 5. Technical Considerations
- **Backend:** A scheduled job (e.g., cron job) is required to run on the first day of every month to handle the cloning of budgets and recurring transactions.
- **Database:** The schema must support one-to-many relationships between users and budgets, and users and transactions. Transactions need a foreign key to budgets. A separate table will be needed for recurring transaction templates.
- **API:** Endpoints must be created for all CRUD operations on budgets and transactions. The dashboard will require an efficient aggregation endpoint to gather all necessary data in a single call.
- **Data Integrity:** All financial calculations must be handled carefully, preferably on the backend, to avoid floating-point inaccuracies and ensure consistency. The synchronization with the user's total asset value must be transactional.

## 6. Future Enhancements
- **Custom Categories:** Allow users to create their own categories and sub-categories.
- **Savings Goals:** Introduce a feature for setting and tracking savings goals (e.g., "Vacation Fund").
- **Notifications:** Alert users when they are approaching or have exceeded a budget limit.
- **Advanced Reporting:** Generate downloadable weekly, monthly, or yearly financial reports.
- **Bank Account Sync:** Allow users to securely connect their bank accounts (via Plaid or a similar service) to automatically import transactions.
