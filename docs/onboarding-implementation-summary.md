## 🏗️ Architecture

### System Flow

```
1. User lands on /onboarding page
2. Initialize onboarding session (API call)
3. Start AI conversation with specialized prompt
4. AI conducts interview using:
   - Conversational messages
   - Interactive UI components (via function calling)
5. Collect and analyze user responses
6. Determine financial stage using AI + fallback logic
7. Complete onboarding and redirect to main app
```

### Key Technologies

- **Frontend**: Next.js 14, React, TypeScript
- **AI**: OpenAI GPT-4.1 with function calling
- **Backend**: Next.js API routes
- **Database**: Supabase (PostgreSQL)
- **Streaming**: Server-Sent Events (SSE)
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS (following brand guidelines)

## 🔧 Configuration

### Environment Variables Required

```bash
# OpenAI
OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_api_key

# Supabase
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL=your_supabase_url
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your_supabase_anon_key
```

### Database Setup

1. Run the migration:
```sql
-- Execute the migration file
\i supabase/migrations/20250103_onboarding_schema.sql
```

2. Verify tables are created:
```sql
SELECT tablename FROM pg_tables WHERE schemaname = 'public' AND tablename LIKE 'onboarding%';
```

## 🧪 Testing Instructions

### 1. Basic Flow Test

1. **Start the application:**
```bash
npm run dev
```

2. **Navigate to onboarding:**
   - Go to `http://localhost:3000/onboarding`
   - Ensure you're authenticated (sign up/sign in first)

3. **Test the flow:**
   - Should see AI welcome message
   - AI should show introduction template component
   - Fill out introduction and submit
   - AI should continue with follow-up questions
   - AI should show appropriate components based on responses

### 2. Component Testing

Test each component type:

- **Introduction Template**: Basic user introduction
- **Multiple Choice**: Risk tolerance, experience levels
- **Financial Input**: Income, expenses, debts, savings
- **Rating Scale**: Comfort levels, confidence ratings
- **Text Input**: Goals, specific concerns

### 3. API Testing

Use curl or Postman to test endpoints:

```bash
# Initialize onboarding
curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/api/onboarding/initialize \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"userId": "user_id_here"}'

# Test AI streaming
curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/api/onboarding/ai-stream \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "message": "Hello, I want to start my financial journey",
    "conversationHistory": [],
    "userProfile": {"name": "John"},
    "currentStep": "ai_welcome"
  }'
```

### 4. Database Testing

Verify data is being stored:

```sql
-- Check onboarding responses
SELECT * FROM onboarding_responses ORDER BY created_at DESC;

-- Check user profiles
SELECT * FROM onboarding_profiles ORDER BY created_at DESC;

-- Check users completion status
SELECT user_id, name, onboarding_completed, onboarding_completed_at 
FROM users WHERE onboarding_completed = true;
```
