# Infina PFA Frontend Migration Plan

> **Version**: 1.0  
> **Date**: 2025-07-29  
> **Status**: Planning Phase  
> **Scope**: Next.js Frontend Integration with Financial Service  
> **Approach**: Feature-based shippable increments

## 📋 Executive Summary

This document outlines the frontend migration plan to integrate the Next.js frontend with the new NestJS Financial Service. The approach focuses on feature-based development where each frontend feature is independently shippable and provides immediate user value.

**Key Principles:**

1. **Feature-based shipping** - Ship complete UI features when ready
2. **Independent deployment** - Each feature can be deployed separately
3. **Progressive enhancement** - Build on existing UI patterns
4. **User-centric value** - Each feature delivers immediate user benefit

## 🎯 Current Frontend State

### **Current Technology Stack**

```
Next.js 15 (App Router)
├── Frontend: React 19 + TypeScript
├── State Management: SWR for data fetching
├── Styling: Tailwind CSS
├── Forms: React Hook Form
├── UI Components: Custom component library
└── Authentication: Supabase Auth integration
```

### **Current Frontend Structure**

```

```

### **Migration Scope**

- **API Integration**: Update service calls to new Financial Service
- **State Management**: Maintain SWR patterns with new endpoints
- **Component Updates**: Enhance components for new features
- **Type Safety**: Update TypeScript types for new API contracts
- **Authentication**: Integrate with backend auth flow

## 📦 Frontend Feature Architecture

### **🎯 Feature Categories & Dependencies**

**🏗️ Foundation Features (Required First)**

- FF1: API Client & Authentication Setup

**💰 Onboarding flow**

- FF2: Update to use new API endpoints + remove AI, prompting logic
- FF3: Update chat component that only convert to text only, no APIs call anymore

**📊 Daily chat**

- FF4: Update API endpoint
- FF5: Remove prompts, AI logic

**📊 Tools**

- FF6: Update API endpoints

## 🎯 Success Criteria

### **Feature Completion Criteria**

**Each frontend feature is considered complete when**:

- ✅ API integration is working correctly
- ✅ Error handling covers all edge cases
- ✅ Loading states provide good UX
- ✅ Mobile experience is optimized
- ✅ Performance metrics are within targets
