- The **service layer** acts as a clean "function library" that knows how to talk to your API routes.
- The **SWR layer** acts as a "smart data manager" that uses the service layer to fetch, cache, and synchronize data for your components automatically.

## The Restaurant Analogy 🍽️

Think of your application's data flow like ordering at a fine dining restaurant.

- **Your Backend (BE):** The Farm 🧑‍🌾. It's the ultimate source of the raw ingredients (your data).
- **Your Next.js API Route (The "Proxy"):** The Restaurant's Kitchen 🔪. It takes a simple order and does the complex work of preparing it, possibly adding a "special sauce" (like an API key) before sending it out. This is what you've already built.
- **The Service Layer:** The Waiter's Notepad 📝. A clean, organized list of all possible menu items (`getBudgets`, `addSpending`). The waiter just needs to write down the item, not how it's made.
- **The SWR Layer (Custom Hook):** The Waiter 🤵. The waiter is the smart one. They take your order using their notepad, manage the status ("the kitchen is preparing your food"), remember what you ordered last time (caching), and check back to see if you need anything else (revalidation).
- **The UI Component:** You, the Customer 🙋. You don't need to know anything about the kitchen or the farm. You just tell the waiter, "I'll have the steak."

## The Service Layer: Your App's "API Menu"

The service layer's job is to abstract away the details of making a network request. It creates a clean, reusable function for every API endpoint you want to call. Your components will call these functions instead of using `fetch` directly.

**Responsibilities:**

- Knowing the exact URL of your Next.js API route (e.g., `/api/budgets`).
- Setting the correct HTTP method (`GET`, `POST`, etc.).
- Formatting the request body into JSON.
- Throwing a standardized error if the request fails.

#### **`./services/budgetService.ts`**

```typescript
import { apiClient } from "./apiClient"; // Assuming you have a centralized client
import { Budget } from "./types"; // Assuming types are defined

export const budgetService = {
  /**
   * Fetches all budgets from our Next.js API route.
   */
  async getBudgets(): Promise<Budget[]> {
    // This function knows HOW to talk to the /api/budgets endpoint.
    // The rest of the app doesn't need to know this detail.
    return apiClient("/budgets");
  },

  /**
   * Creates a new budget.
   */
  async createBudget(newBudgetData: {
    name: string;
    amount: number;
  }): Promise<Budget> {
    return apiClient("/budgets", {
      method: "POST",
      body: JSON.stringify(newBudgetData),
    });
  },
};
```

## The SWR Layer: Your "Smart Data Manager"

The SWR layer, implemented as custom hooks (`useBudgets`), connects the service layer to your UI. It handles the entire lifecycle of the data fetched from your service.

**Responsibilities:**

- **Caching:** Automatically stores the result of `getBudgets()`. If another component calls `useBudgets()`, it will receive the cached data instantly without a new network request.
- **State Management:** Provides your components with simple `data`, `isLoading`, and `isError` states out of the box.
- **Automatic Revalidation:** Keeps data fresh by automatically refetching when the user re-focuses the window, reconnects to the internet, etc.
- **Mutations:** Provides functions to update the data and intelligently revalidate the cache.

#### **`./hooks/useBudgets.ts`**

```typescript
"use client";

import useSWR from "swr";
import { budgetService } from "@/services/budgetService";

export function useBudgets() {
  // SWR uses the service function to fetch data.
  // It then handles all the caching, loading states, and revalidation.
  const { data, error, isLoading, mutate } = useSWR(
    "budgets", // A unique key for this data cache
    budgetService.getBudgets
  );

  // The hook can also provide its own mutation functions.
  const createBudget = async (newBudgetData: {
    name: string;
    amount: number;
  }) => {
    await budgetService.createBudget(newBudgetData);
    mutate(); // Tell SWR to revalidate the 'budgets' cache.
  };

  return {
    budgets: data,
    isLoading,
    isError: error,
    createBudget,
  };
}
```

## How They Work Together

1.  A UI component calls `const { budgets } = useBudgets();`.
2.  The `useBudgets` hook tells SWR to get data for the `'budgets'` key.
3.  SWR calls its fetcher, `budgetService.getBudgets()`.
4.  The `budgetService` makes a `fetch` call to your Next.js route: `/api/budgets`.
5.  Your Next.js route at `/app/api/budgets/route.ts` receives the call and forwards it to your real backend.

By separating these layers, you create a highly organized, maintainable, and powerful frontend architecture. Your UI components are simple and declarative, while all the complex logic of data fetching, caching, and state management is handled for you by SWR and your services.
