# Emergency Fund Advisor - Missing Components PRD

## üìã Product Requirements Document
**Version:** 1.0  
**Date:** January 2025  
**Project:** Infina PFA - Emergency Fund Advisor Components  

---

## üéØ Executive Summary

This PRD outlines the missing UI components required for the Emergency Fund Advisor AI to function according to its system prompt specifications. The AI currently lacks 7 critical components needed to execute the three main behavioral scenarios: Start of Month, End of Month, and Normal Day interactions.

## üîç Problem Statement

The Emergency Fund Advisor system prompt defines specific UI components that the AI should activate during different scenarios, but these components are not yet implemented:

- **Start of Month:** Requires Goal Dashboard and Pay Yourself First Confirmation
- **End of Month:** Requires Monthly Budget Analysis, Surplus Allocation, and Next Month Planner  
- **Normal Day:** Requires Budgeting Dashboard for daily spending control
- **All Scenarios:** Need Emergency Fund Tracker for progress visibility

## üèóÔ∏è Technical Architecture

### Component Integration Pattern
```typescript
// Each component follows this structure:
1. ChatComponentId enum addition
2. Component definition in tools/definitions.ts
3. React component in components/chat/
4. Message wrapper component for chat integration
5. SWR hook for data fetching (if needed)
```

### Data Flow

All components must integrate with existing MCP tools:
- `goal-management`: For Emergency Fund operations
- `budget-management`: For budget data and expense logging

### SWR Data Fetching
Each component should use the existing SWR pattern:
```typescript
// Example hook structure
export const useGoalDashboardSWR = () => {
  return useSWR(['goal-dashboard'], goalService.getDashboardData, {
    refreshInterval: 30000, // Refresh every 30 seconds
  });
};
```

### Translation Support
All text must be internationalized:
- Vietnamese (primary)
- English (secondary)
- Use `useAppTranslation` hook
- Follow existing naming conventions
