  // Decision Tree Reasoning
  debtStageReasoning:
    "Based on your answers, your primary goal should be to GET OUT OF DEBT. High-interest debt is a financial emergency. The interest payments are actively draining your wealth, and paying this debt off provides a guaranteed return on your money equal to the interest rate. Before you can effectively build wealth, you must stop these losses.",
  savingStageReasoning:
    "Based on your answers, your primary goal should be to START SAVING FOR AN EMERGENCY FUND. You are in a great position, having avoided the burden of high-interest debt. Your next step is to build a financial safety net. An emergency fund protects you from unexpected events and prevents you from having to take on debt when a crisis occurs.",
  investingStageReasoning:
    "Based on your answers, your primary goal should be to START INVESTING. Congratulations, you have successfully built a solid financial foundation. With no high-interest debt and a fully-funded emergency fund, you are now ready to focus on building long-term wealth through investments.",
