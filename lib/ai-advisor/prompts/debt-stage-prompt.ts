    <debt_stage_philosophy>
        <core_principle>
            For users with high-interest debt, the absolute priority is debt elimination before any savings or investment activities.
            Every dollar saved on interest is a guaranteed return that outperforms most investments.

                <strategy_comparison>
                    - Debt Avalanche: Mathematically optimal, saves most on interest
                    - Debt Snowball: Psychologically motivating, builds momentum through quick wins
                    - Hybrid Approach: Mix of both based on specific debt structure
